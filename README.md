"Our project is a Spam Email Detection System that uses a machine learning model to identify whether an email is spam or not. It processes the email text, converts it into numerical data, and predicts its category using a Naive Bayes algorithm. The system is user-friendly and can help individuals and businesses manage unwanted emails efficiently."
